First of all: *main.py* is not the beginning of the program, but rather *big.py*. It was
an ongoing project and didnâ€™t go through a cleaning phase. Sorry for that.

This program converts an .htm
to an .csv appending a timestamp so it can
be used as a Data Source, or easily converted into a Data Warehouse.

It is made for a very specific problem, but maybe it could inspire you to adapt it
to your own needs.
