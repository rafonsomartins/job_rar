First of all: main.py is not the beggining of the program but rather big.py. It was
an ongoing project and it didn't pass throught a cleaning phase. Sorry for that.

This program converts a .html to a .csv appending it with the timestamp so it can
be used as a Data Source, or easily converted into a Data Warehouse.

It is made for a very specific problem, but maybe it could inspire you to adapt it
to your own needs.

There is an example of a raw .html that this program expects.
