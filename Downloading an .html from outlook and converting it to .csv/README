First of all: *main.py* is not the beggining of the program, but rather *big.py*. It was
an ongoing project and didnâ€™t go through a cleaning phase. Sorry for that.

This program converts an .html to an .csv appending it with the timestamp so it can
be used as a Data Source, or easily converted into a Data Warehouse.

It is made for a very specific problem, but maybe it could inspire you to adapt it
to your own needs.

There is an example of a raw .html that this program expects in this folder of the repo.
