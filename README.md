Some python scripts I developed with the goals to:
- experiment and learn
- quickly solve some quotidian job problems

I am posting them on my github to show my work, but mainly with hope that they might help someone in their learning curve.

I did not "cleaned" the scripts before posting them, so the names and the code itself are a bit confusing with few abstraction layers.
I am sorry for that.

Feel free to DM me for any question that might show up.
