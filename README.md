Some Python scripts I developed with the goals of:
- Experiment and learn
- Quickly solve some everyday work problems

I am posting them on my GitHub to showcase my work, but mainly with the hope that they might help someone in their learning curve.

I did not "clean" the scripts before posting them, so the names and the code itself may be a bit confusing, with few abstraction layers.
I apologize for that.

Feel free to DM me if you have any questions.
