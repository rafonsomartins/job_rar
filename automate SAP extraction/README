This is a quick academic script to showcase the power of pyautogui.
Please don’t use it with bad intentions.

The names of the windows might differ across versions of SAP and different computers.

The coordinates will certainly differ from computer to computer. One solution would
be to use relative (percentual) coordinates.

Once again, I apologize for the unorganized and amateur code. As explained before, this
is not a script intended for production—just to experiment with new libraries.

Hope this helps someone.
