This is a quick academic script to show the power of pyautogui.
Don't use it with bad intention.

The name of the windows might differ from versions of SAP and versions of computers.

The coordinates will surelly differ from computer to computer. One solution would
be to use relative (percentual) coordinates.

Once again, i am sorry for the unorganized and amateur code. As explained before is
not a script intended to be in production, just to experiment new libraries.

Hope this helps someone.
